This is just documentation for my config files. It is yet to be seen what this will become.

* TODO
+ [ ] Better org file display in github (perhaps a preview)
+ [ ] Setup better pdf viewer
+ [ ] Possibly setup email client
+ [ ] Git integration

* Evil mode
I mainly use evil mode, no custom bindings yet but I have heard the SPC-e is not bound to
anything so I will use that if I need to.

* PDF-Viewer
Note the script pdflatex_shell_escape.sh, the default latex compiler is set to use this
script so that I can use the --shell-escape flag.

** TODO : better solution to --shell-escape problem
Perhaps permanently change the default compiler or at least be able to optionally choose the
compiler script.
